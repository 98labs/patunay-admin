# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Problem
After login, the user object remains null and there are 401 unauthorized errors. The authentication state was not being properly initialized in the Redux store after successful login.

## Root Causes
1. The login mutation was not fetching the full user profile data
2. The SessionContext was not initializing the Redux auth state
3. The auth state initialization was not being triggered after login
4. Missing proper error handling and fallbacks for profile fetching

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Login Mutation (`/src/ui/store/api/userApi.ts`)
- Modified the login mutation to fetch the user profile immediately after successful authentication
- Added fallback handling if profile fetch fails
- Returns complete user data with the login response

### 2. Updated SessionContext (`/src/ui/context/SessionContext.tsx`)
- Added Redux dispatch integration
- Automatically initializes auth state when a session is detected
- Triggers auth state updates on auth state changes

### 3. Improved Auth Slice (`/src/ui/store/features/auth/authSliceV2.ts`)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improved error handling in initializeAuth thunk
- Added fallback user data if profile fetch fails
- Fixed userId assignment to use user.id instead of session.user.id

### 4. Enhanced Login Component (`/src/ui/pages/Login/Login.tsx`)
- Added auth state initialization after successful login
- Added delay to ensure auth state propagates properly
- Properly typed the dispatch with AppDispatch

### 5. Improved Supabase Client (`/src/ui/supabase/index.ts`)
- Added explicit auth configuration options
- Added auth state change listener for debugging
- Configured proper storage and session persistence

### 6. Updated getCurrentUser Query
- Modified to try profiles table first, then fallback to current_user_profile view
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallback user data

## Testing

Created a test script at `/scripts/test-auth-flow.js` to verify:
1. Login functionality
2. Session persistence
3. Profile fetching
4. Organization loading
5. Logout functionality

## Usage

To test the authentication flow:
```bash
node scripts/test-auth-flow.js
```

## Debugging

The following console logs have been added for debugging:
- `Supabase: Auth state changed:` - Logs all auth state changes
- `AuthSlice: Initializing auth` - Logs when auth initialization starts
- `AuthSlice: User data prepared:` - Shows the prepared user data
- `SessionProvider: Session loaded` - Indicates session status

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for error logs
2. Verify the profiles table has a record for the logged-in user
3. Check network tab for failed API requests
4. Ensure environment variables are correctly set
5. Verify Supabase RLS policies allow profile access
