# Authentication Session Fix

## Problem
Users were getting logged out immediately after login with the following error logs:
- "AuthSlice: No session found"
- "initializeAuth fulfilled with payload: null"
- "No auth payload, user logged out"

## Root Cause
The issue was a race condition between:
1. Supabase storing the session after login
2. The Redux auth state trying to read the session immediately

When `initializeAuth` was called right after login, `supabase.auth.getSession()` would return null because the session hadn't been fully persisted yet.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Login Mutation (`userApi.ts`)
- Added session verification after login
- Wait 100ms for session to be stored
- Verify session exists before returning
- Added fallback user data if profile fetch fails

### 2. Updated Auth Initialization (`authSliceV2.ts`)
- Added retry logic with up to 3 attempts
- 500ms delay between retries
- Better error logging

### 3. Improved Login Component (`Login.tsx`)
- Increased wait time to 500ms after login
- Added comprehensive logging
- Better error handling for auth initialization

### 4. Enhanced SessionContext (`SessionContext.tsx`)
- Listen for auth state changes first
- Handle multiple auth events (SIGNED_IN, TOKEN_REFRESHED, INITIAL_SESSION)
- Better logging for debugging

### 5. Updated Supabase Client (`supabase/index.ts`)
- Added debug mode for better logging
- Enhanced auth state change listener with more details
- Added client identification header

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the auth flow:
```bash
node scripts/test-auth-session.js [email] [password]
```

This script tests:
1. Current session state
2. Login functionality
3. Session storage verification
4. Profile fetching
5. Auth state changes
6. Session refresh
7. Logout functionality
8. Session cleanup

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Timing Issues**: Added delays and retries to handle async session storage
2. **Verification**: Added session verification after login
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallbacks
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the auth flow
5. **Event Handling**: Properly handle all auth state change events

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Look for "Supabase: Auth state changed" messages
3. Verify "AuthSlice: Session found" appears after login
4. Check network tab for any 401 errors
5. Run the test script to verify backend auth is working

## Implementation Notes

The fix ensures that:
- Sessions are properly stored before initialization
- Auth state is synchronized between Supabase and Redux
- Proper fallbacks exist if profile data is unavailable
- Race conditions are handled with retry logic
