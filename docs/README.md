## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- NFC reader hardware (for NFC functionality)
- Supabase project with proper configuration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd patunay-admin
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
# Edit .env.development with your Supabase credentials
```

4. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the React dev server (port 5173) and Electron application.

## Development Commands

### Development Mode
- `npm run dev` - Start both React and Electron in development mode
- `npm run dev:react` - Start only React dev server
- `npm run dev:electron` - Start only Electron (requires transpiled code)

### Building
- `npm run build` - Full production build
- `npm run build:react` - Build React frontend only
- `npm run build:electron` - Build Electron app only

### Distribution
- `npm run dist:mac` - Package for macOS ARM64
- `npm run dist:win` - Package for Windows x64
- `npm run dist:linux` - Package for Linux x64

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Optional Configuration
```env
DISABLE_DEVTOOLS=true    # Disable DevTools in development
ENABLE_DEVTOOLS=true     # Force enable DevTools
```

## Application Architecture

### Dual Process Architecture
- **Main Process**: Handles system integration, NFC communication, and application lifecycle
- **Renderer Process**: React-based UI with full artwork management capabilities

### Key Design Patterns
- **Redux Toolkit** for predictable state management
- **Component composition** with reusable UI components
- **Hook-based architecture** for logic reuse
- **RPC pattern** for Supabase database operations

## Features in Detail

### NFC Functionality
- Read existing NFC tags to identify artworks
- Write artwork IDs to blank NFC tags
- Monitor NFC reader status and connectivity
- Support for various NFC tag types

### Artwork Registration Workflow

2. Image upload and management
3. Size and technical specifications
4. Bibliography and provenance
5. Collector information
6. NFC tag attachment
7. Final review and submission

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Role-based access control
- Secure file upload handling
- Data sanitization and validation
