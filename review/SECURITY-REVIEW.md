🚨 Critical Security & Reliability Issues

  1. Security Vulnerabilities [✅ DONE]
  - Missing environment variable validation in Supabase client (src/ui/supabase/index.ts)
  - No IPC message validation in main process (src/electron/main.ts:47-49)
  - Hardcoded development URLs that could leak into production

  2. Poor Error Handling [✅ DONE]
  - Using alert() instead of proper notifications (src/ui/pages/RegisterArtwork/components/steps/AttachNfc.tsx:83)
  - No React error boundaries
  - Missing error handling in NFC operations

  🔧 Architecture Improvements

  3. Type Safety Issues [✅ DONE]
  - Inconsistent type definitions between Electron and UI processes
  - Mixed file extensions (.cts vs .ts)
  - Missing strict TypeScript configuration

  4. State Management [✅ DONE]
  - Limited Redux structure for a growing app
  - Consider implementing RTK Query for better data fetching
  - No proper state management for NFC operations

  ⚡ Performance Optimizations

  5. Bundle Size Concerns [✅ DONE]
  - Replace deprecated moment.js with date-fns
  - Missing React performance optimizations (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
  - No code splitting strategy

  6. Build Process [✅ DONE]
  - Complex build commands with redundancy
  - Missing test infrastructure
  - No clear development/production distinction

  🛠️ Code Quality Fixes

  7. Dependencies [✅ DONE]
  - Update to latest Electron version
  - Remove unmaintained packages like os-utils
  - Add missing testing libraries

  8. Development Experience [✅ DONE]
  - Inconsistent coding patterns across components
  - Console.log statements in production code
  - Missing API and component documentation

  📋 Immediate Action Items [✅ DONE]

  1. Fix security issues - Add environment validation and IPC message validation
  2. Implement proper error handling - Replace alerts with notification system
  3. Add React error boundaries - Prevent app crashes from component errors
  4. Enable strict TypeScript - Catch type issues early
  5. Add testing infrastructure - Jest + React Testing Library
  6. Replace moment.js - Reduce bundle size significantly
